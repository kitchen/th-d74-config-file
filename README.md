I got a [Kenwood TH-D74A](http://www.kenwood.com/usa/com/amateur/th-d74a/) radio recently. It's pretty heckin' cool.

One of the really cool things it has is the ability to dump its configuration out to a file on a microsd card.
It can also import configuration from a file on a microsd card.

There doesn't seem to be any documentation that I can find on the file format.
Kenwood ships [software](http://www.kenwood.com/i/products/info/amateur/mcpd74_e.html) for Windows that can be used to configure the radio, but it's only for Windows.
I don't use Windows, and CHIRP doesn't yet support programming this radio, so I figured I'd take a stab at out-of-band programming for it.
At the very least, maybe my experiments and attempts to reverse engineer and document the config file format will be useful to someone else later.
