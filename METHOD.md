My method for reverse engineering this config file is very simple:

1) save configuration.
2) change something.
3) save configuration.
4) hexdump both files. compare.
5) repeat

Until now I've been swapping the SD card back and forth, but silly me, I can enable USB mass storage mode in the radio and just get at things directly. So much easier.
