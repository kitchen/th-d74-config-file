# Channel memory banks
* Identify size of each channel memory.
  - I intend to do this by making 4 identical memories and then changing the same field (probably tone setting) in each one.
* How is the memory stored?
  - Once I've identified the length of each memory record, I can dig into each one and twiddle knobs, seeing what changes.

## memory entry elements
* memory number (this might be merely a function of position or order)
* frequency
* squelch mode
* squelch code
* group number
* name (fairly certain this is stored in a separate area in the file as they seemed to be all together in one place)
* repeater offset
* odd split info
* modulation mode (FM, AM, SSB, etc)
* digital? I'm not sure if this info is stored per memory. Fairly sure d-star repeaters are in an entirely different part of the config. And aprs you just tune to a frequency and turn it on.
* transmit lock (at least I think that's what that setting means, you can't transmit on that frequency but you can tune it)
